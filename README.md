These are examples of my work in data science using Excel, R, SQL, and PowerBI to analyze data and solve business problems.

# Project 1 - Bellabeat Case Study: Project Overview
* Used FitBit Fitness Tracker data from Amazon Mechanical Turk survey and hosted on Kaggle to analyze trends in fitness tracker usage to make business decisions for the wellness company Bellabeat.
* Cleaned data in Excel and R, created visualizations in both
* Found interesting insights in usage data, and relationships between BMI and manual tracking of weight, as well as steps versus calories burned.

* Only 18% of FitBit users tracked their weight manually. Bellabeat should put emphasis on using the tracking functions as what is measured can be managed. Both our data and the American Heart Association report that tracking weight can lead to maintaining a healthier weight.

* Here we can see a correlation between whether BMI/weight were manually tracked, and the average BMI of the respective users. Any BMI over 25 is considered overweight or obese, and all of those who tracked manually are under this threshold, where all of those who did not are above it.

* The last two graphs show the relationships between steps or distance traveled and calories burned. Health institutions recommend 10,000 steps per day, but here we show that there is a large range of steps or distance with a similar amount of calories burned, and diminishing returns past a certain point. The 10,000 steps recommendation may be a useful starting point, but Bellabeat can show a more refined approach to tracking steps and getting results.
