These are examples of my work in data science using Excel, R, SQL, and PowerBI to analyze data and solve business problems.

# Project 1 - Bellabeat Case Study: Project Overview
* Used FitBit Fitness Tracker data from Amazon Mechanical Turk survey and hosted on Kaggle to analyze trends in fitness tracker usage to make business decisions for the wellness company Bellabeat.
* Cleaned data in Excel and R, created visualizations in both
* Found interesting insights in usage data, and relationships between BMI and manual tracking of weight, as well as steps versus calories burned.
